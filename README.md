# pooling-shot-projectiles
Unity - Pooling Shot Projectiles. A projectile (shot) moves forward fast from a source (fighter space ship).  The shots are pooled so that each shot is not created and destroyed as fired (slows game down).  The fire rate is controlled so that you can only fire X shots per second.
